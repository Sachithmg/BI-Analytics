# Carbon Capture as a Service (CCaaS) - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Analysis

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Time Series Analysis on the implementation of Carbon Capture as a Service (CCaaS) across multiple manufacturing sites. The analysis aims to provide insights into the operational efficiency, financial viability, and environmental impact of CCaaS adoption in various industrial processes.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis include:
- **Assessing Operational Efficiency:** Analyzing CO2 capture volumes, energy consumption, and plant uptime to evaluate efficiency across different sites.
- **Evaluating Financial Viability:** Examining revenue streams from CO2 sales and carbon credits, and comparing them against operational costs to assess profitability.
- **Quantifying Environmental Impact:** Measuring CO2 emissions mitigated through CCaaS to understand its effectiveness in reducing the carbon footprint.
- **Identifying Patterns and Trends:** Exploring temporal patterns and correlations among key metrics across different sites.
- **Providing Strategic Recommendations:** Offering data-driven strategies to optimize CCaaS implementation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis is a synthetic GPT-generated dataset covering five distinct manufacturing processes across five organizational sites over the past two years. Key metrics include:
- CO2 captured (tons)
- Operational costs (USD)
- Energy consumption (kWh)
- Revenue from CO2 sales and carbon credits (USD)
- Plant uptime percentage
- Customer satisfaction score

## Key Findings

### Operational Insights
- **CO2 Capture Efficiency:** Sites showed significant variability in CO2 capture rates and energy efficiency, indicating potential areas for optimization.
- **Cost and Revenue Analysis:** Operational costs fluctuated across sites, with some sites showing inefficiencies that need addressing. Revenue from CO2 sales and carbon credits was not always correlated with CO2 capture rates, suggesting the influence of external market factors.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Customer satisfaction was found to be influenced by CO2 capture efficiency, operational costs, and revenue generation, with varying impacts across sites.

### Financial Performance
- **ROI Analysis:** Return on Investment (ROI) varied significantly across sites, with some sites showing negative ROI, highlighting financial challenges that require strategic intervention.
- **Cost Management:** Sites with higher operational costs need to focus on cost management strategies to improve financial performance.

### Environmental Impact
- **CO2 Emissions Reduction:** The implementation of CCaaS across sites led to significant reductions in CO2 emissions, contributing positively to environmental sustainability.

## Methodologies

- **Data Cleaning:** Missing values were handled using imputation techniques based on data distribution. Outliers were detected and treated using a cap and floor approach.
- **Feature Engineering:** New features were created to capture essential aspects of the dataset, such as CO2 capture efficiency, revenue per ton of CO2, and rolling averages.
- **Temporal and Correlation Analysis:** The analysis included time series decomposition to identify seasonal trends and correlation matrices to explore relationships between key variables.

## Strategic Recommendations

- **Process Optimization:** Sites should focus on improving energy efficiency and CO2 capture processes to enhance operational performance.
- **Financial Strategy:** Regular financial reviews and dynamic pricing strategies are recommended to stabilize and improve ROI.
- **Sustainability Improvements:** Increasing CO2 capture efficiency and exploring revenue opportunities from captured CO2 can further enhance environmental and financial outcomes.

## Conclusion

The EDA and Time Series Analysis provide valuable insights into the performance of CCaaS across multiple sites. By leveraging these insights, organizations can make informed decisions to optimize their carbon capture processes, improve financial returns, and contribute to environmental sustainability.
